Performing approximate median filtering for moving object segmentation
using deep learning can be approached in various ways. Hereâ€™s a detailed example
demonstrating how you can use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to achieve this.
The goal is to train a CNN to approximate the effect of a median filter and use it for moving object segmentation.

Example: Approximating Median Filter for Moving Object Segmentation
This example will use PyTorch to implement a simple CNN that approximates median filtering. The process involves:
